# Software-Development-Coursework
A threaded Java implementation of a simple card game.

Running the test suite:
  - Open the project in intellij.
  - Run the TestSuite.java file.
  - If all tests pass and no unexpected exceptions are thrown, intellij will return exit code 0.
  
Note that tests may take a few seconds (about 10) since to test the threaded parts of the code
we used Thread.sleep() which will delay the test completion.
